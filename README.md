### Learning is intrinsic to life.

We live in an era where the scope of all human knowledge is at our fingertips. Every moment is an opportunity to grasp hold of grand ideas beyond the imagination of our ancestors. We have measured the collision of black holes and the existence of the Higgs boson. Rockets are reusable, cars are electric, and robots can dance. Every aspect of society is transforming before our eyes. It is a wonderful time to be alive.

### A new era has begun...

and it is time our education system matches our reality. With the advent of AI and the internet, it is possible to provide a learning experience in harmony with our lives. This is the mission of edAstra.
